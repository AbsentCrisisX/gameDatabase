<h1>Game catalog</h1>
<p>This project is made to practice my own Laravel programming. Currently it's a basic project which uses basic MVC to give a user the ability to add a game into their list, view their list, write a review about a game that they own, add a game genre to the system, and to view all written reviews.</p>
